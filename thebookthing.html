    Chapter 1: The Forest 
    In a land far, far away there was once a boy named Steve. 
    One day he got very mad at his parents for whatever reason 
    and went into the dark forest. The dark forest was very big
    and spooky, but nobody bothered him there, so he went in
    quite often. Today, however, he decided to explore the forest
    instead of sitting on a log near the stream like he usually 
    did. He went off the trail and then somehow he found himself
    lostin the forest. 
    
    Chapter 2 : The Shark
    As Steve was wandering through the forest, suddenly he heard 
    a noise! It sounded like a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . shark!
    His parents had warned him about the sharks in the forest, but
    he never listened to them. He just assumed it was an old folk 
    tale to scare children from going into the forest, but 
    apparently, it wasn't. 
    
    “Whaaaaaaa!!! A shark!” he yelled, waving his arms in fright!
    
    “Come with me,” he heard a voice say. 
    
    Steve said,  “No! I will not come!”  
    
    “Then we must force you to come. The shark king wants you.”
    Then the next thing he knew he was knocked out.
    
    
    
    
    Chapter 3 : The Shark King
    When he woke up he was sitting in a cross legged position
    all tied up on the ground. A large shark wearing a golden 
    crown and a white, red, and black robe was sitting on a throne
    in front of him holding a scepter. The shark also had a mustache. 
    
    “Why are you trespassing in our lands?” growled the shark king. 
    
    “Umm . . . . .” Steve said. 
    
    “Put him to death!” yelled the shark king! 
    
    “No!” Steve said as he was carried away by some sharks! 
    
    “Maybe I can escape,” thought Steve. 
    
         Then the sharks prepared to hang him. 
    
    Chapter 4: The Escape 
    While the sharks were preparing to hang him he thought, “Well, at
    least they made one mistake; they forgot to disarm me.” So while
    the sharks were working on the gallows, he began sawing at the
    ropes with his penknife. He sawed and sawed and sawed and, 
    finally, he cut his ropes! Then he sneakily got up. 
    
    “Look! He’s escaping!” cried one of the sharks. “Get him!” 
    
    As a hoard of sharks chased after him, he ran as fast as he could
    out of the forest and back home.  When he got home he did not tell
    anyone, because they would not have believed him. Imagine your
    younger sibling or your son or daughter saying, “Hey, I just went
    into the forest and discovered a flying shark wearing a gold
    crown, and I barely escaped with my life.” Would you have believed
    them? So that was why he did not tell them. Later he became an
    author and wrote a story about the same thing happening to a
    different boy, and that is the story you are reading now. 
    
    The end. </pre>
          <pre id="demo2" class='hide'>Book 2!!!!
    Far, far, away and there was once a time portal. And then a big
    dinosaur came out! Then the dinosaur started rampaging around the
    city! Then the police came to stop it but they couldn't because it
    could breathe fire. Then the Army came to stop it but Russia
    invaded because the army was preoccupied. Then Russia and America
    fought and fought and fought. Then America invaded Russia so that
    Russia and America switched places and then Russia had to take
    care of the big dinosaur. So Russia started shooting at it buuuut
    ......... The dinosaur’s hide was impenetrable! Its teeth were
    sharper than lasers!! It was 10,000 meters tall!!! So when Russia
    eventually succeeded bombing it but then they accidentally blew up
    earth along with the dinosaur so only the people in space survived
    the apocalypse of the gigantic dinosaur.
                                     The end.

    Chapter 1
    In the same place as The Shark King happened Steve decided to
    explore the quarry.Luckily his parents said he could go, so he
    went. While he was there he saw something that looked like a small
    crater. He went to look closer. When he did, he saw . . . . . . .
    . . . . . . . a giant footprint! He was amazed! Then a huge
    booming voice said “Fee, fi, fo, fum, I smell the blood of an
    Englishman!” 
    
    “Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!” Steve screamed. Then the giant
    picked him up and took him away. 
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Chapter 2
    The giant went to a big mansion that had a huge double door and
    went inside. The worst part about it was that the giant had a dog
    that was also giant sized, so that even if Steve escaped from the
    giant, he would have to face the dog to escape from the palace.
    The  giant started to prepare the stew. “You will be the last
    ingredient, human, because I want you to see what will happen to
    you before you die!” Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!” laughed the giant.
    
    
    
    
    Chapter 3
    While he was in the giant's palace in a cage, Steve decided to try
    to escape. He tried to fit through the bars, cut them, and even
    bend them! Then the giant picked him up and started carrying him
    over to the boiling pot over the fire! But then .......... Steve
    stabbed the giant with his penknife and the giant dropped him
    while howling in pain! Then, Steve ran as fast as he could toward
    the door, but the dog pounced on him! Then he dodged to the left,
    so the dog missed and crashed to the ground! Then the dog pounced
    again, but Steve dodged to the right and the dog crashed to the
    ground again! Then Steve ran as fast as he could toward the door!
    But then……. the dog slowly got up!  Luckily, though, Steve was
    already out the door. Then Steve ran as fast as he could toward
    home. When he got there he didn't tell anyone.
                                  The end.
